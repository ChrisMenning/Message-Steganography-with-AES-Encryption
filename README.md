Image Steganography with AES Encryption v3.0

Overview:

This program allows the user to type a message in plain text (ASCII only) and hide that message within the Least Significant Bit of each color channel of each pixel of a bitmap image, with optional AES Encryption.

Near Roadmap:
* Add character counter to form
* Add File, Edit, etc menu.
* Give user the option to generate a fractal instead of using pre-existing image.
* Add Password input to form.

Addtional Plans:
* Build JPG encoder and decoder
